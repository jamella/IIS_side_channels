The .mat file contains all required information.

We ran the AES on an 8-bit microcontroller, with a fixed key and variable plaintext, and measured the power consumption during encryption. We did 10.000 such measurements.
In the Matlab file, you can find the used plaintexts, the resulting ciphertexts, and the power information (traces). Plaintexts and ciphertexts are stored byte-wise. Each line in the matrizes belongs to 1 measurement.
